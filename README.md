###General Development Guidelines

1. MVC Controllers (Web + API) should be small and thin
1. This repo also has a sub-module **(Electra)** for an OSS library that is also in development.  
1. Please remember to push changes from both the main git repository and the sub-module if modifictions are made there.
1. We use the Git Flow branching strategy which means all work shoudl be done on feature branches, then when done, create a pull request to the develop branch.
